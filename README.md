### A few config files that I dont want to miss if need to configure a new machine

### Terminal-fonts

A few free fonts I like to use to both program or in the terminal

* AnonymousPro
* Inconsolata
* Inconsolata-g
* InconsolataDz
* m-1mm
* m2m (my fav)
* RobotoMono
* SourceCodePro
* Terminus
* UbuntuMono


### oh-my-zsh

First don't forget to install zsh. After that oh-my-zsh is a must.

A few notes:

The theme I'm using requires a font that supports the symbols.

[agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme](https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme)

Some of the alias I have might not work for you so be sure to check that out. Some you might not even need them like the pre-packed alias from ubuntu.


### Text Editors (Sublime text 3)

These setttings require you to have installed the following items:

* [Material Theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme)
* M+ 2m (font)

### Vagrant Lamp Stack (ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS)

You might need to change this a bit to your needs. This is the base machine I use at the momment.
